# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Mary", last_name: "Odegaard", email: "odegaamk@yahoo.com", phone_number: "319-361-0587")

# contact.save

# contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Jessica", last_name: "Gabriel", email: "jkjohnso@gmail.com", phone_number: "319-361-1059")
